# Tar (highly flammable fluid) does not react to fire propagation

## Environment
- **Version:** pre-release/2026.02.06-0baf7c5aa
- **Mode:** All modes
- **Platform:** Windows 11

## Severity
🟡 Medium — Gameplay / Fire Mechanics / Fluids

## Description
When tar is placed and an attempt is made to ignite it with the flamethrower, there is no reaction. This is incorrect given the fluid's nature and represents a missed opportunity in gameplay mechanics by not being able to utilize tar's flammable properties.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Place or locate tar in the world
2. Apply fire with the flamethrower
3. Check if tar ignites in any way

## Expected Result
Tar should catch fire, burning everything in contact with it and eventually extinguishing itself in the process.

## Actual Result
Tar behaves like thicker water with no flammable functionality.

## Reproduction Rate
100% — Always

## QA Notes
- Tested by igniting directly, with burning blocks, on the fluid source block, and on flowing tar blocks
- Having a flammable fluid would add significant value to the game in the future for traps, systems, or emergent gameplay
